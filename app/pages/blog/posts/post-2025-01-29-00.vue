                    For a standing room only crowd, Save the Grove Again&apos;s Lacey Smith brought forth our concerns and requests at the town council meeting Monday night. As Mayor McGee stated &apos;we don&apos;t often have too many visitors here&apos; referring to attendance at town council meetings. But the community showed just how much they care about the future of Gillies Grove, and council took notice. Thanks for all your support!

                    We have now made our formal request to have the Town conduct its own ecological study of the Grove. Lacey made it clear that we need to have this vital information as a community to be best equipped to protect Gillies Grove regardless of what it faces in the future.  It was left that research will be needed to know what options exist for such a study pre-emptive of a development proposal, Town Planner Alix Jolicoeur stated. These options would need to be brought to council at a later date.
