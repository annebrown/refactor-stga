                    Arnprior, ON — The Save the Grove Again Committee invites all residents to join us at Town Hall on Monday, January 27th at 6:30 PM, as Lacey Smith, Chair of Save the Grove Again, delivers an important delegation to Town Council.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-8">
                    This presentation will highlight our collective concerns regarding the protection of Gillies Grove, an irreplaceable old-growth forest that holds immense ecological, historical, and community value. The delegation will serve as both an informative session and a call to action, presenting:
                    </p>
                                 
                    <ul class="mb-8">
                        <li>🌿  The extraordinary biodiversity and rarity of old-growth ecosystems.</li>
                        <li>🌿  The threats posed to Gillies Grove by nearby development.</li>
                        <li>🌿  The alignment of our position with the Town’s Official Plan, emphasizing the need for council to uphold these values.</li>
                    </ul>
                                 
                    <p class="mb-8">
                        Chair Lacey Smith emphasized the urgency of local action, stating: “The Ontario government has weakened Environmental Impact Studies. Should we allow that lowered standard to determine the future of our endangered old-growth forest? The answer is NO.”
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-8">
                        Smith also called on Council to take a leadership role: “We urge Council to uphold the values in the Town’s Official Plan and conduct an independent ecological assessment of Gillies Grove. A developer-funded study simply will not suffice.”
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-8">
                    Your Presence Matters!
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-8">
                    This is a pivotal moment for Gillies Grove. By attending, you can show Town Council how deeply committed our community is to preserving this precious natural landmark. Together, we can ensure that Gillies Grove remains protected for future generations.
                    </p> 

                    <p class="mb-8">
                    If you are unable to attend in person, the meeting will also be live-streamed on the Town’s official YouTube channel.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-8">
                    Let’s stand together for Gillies Grove and demonstrate the strength of our community’s voice.
                    </p>
