                    What if reversing climate change was as simple as planting a tree?

                    Renowned Canadian botanist and filmmaker Dianna Beresford-Krueger has a very simple bioplan to do exactly that—and it’s something each of us can dig right into.

                    If every person on earth plants one native tree each year for the next six years, we could reforest the planet with an estimated 50 billion trees—significantly reducing carbon dioxide levels, stabilizing temperatures, and restoring balance to the carbon cycle by 2030.

                    Each seedling is a bare root Eastern White Pine, a species native to this area and deeply rooted in Arnprior’s identity. It’s the dominant tree in Gillies Grove, our town’s cherished old-growth forest. Beresford-Kroeger calls pines “living pharmacopoeias,” thanks to natural compounds like pinosylvin, a powerful antibiotic.

                    <p className="mb-8 text-justify">
                    This isn’t just about reforesting—it’s about reclaiming agency in the face of climate change. Tree by tree, yard by yard, balcony by balcony, greenspace by greenspace, we can all work together to take back the landscape from deforestation. When you plant a tree, you’re helping cool the air, purify water, anchor soil, and create habitat for birds and pollinators.
                    </p>

                    <p className=" mb-8 text-justify">
                    You’re also helping protect Gillies Grove, a sanctuary of biodiversity that continues to be threatened by nearby development.
