    <strong>
        Save the Grove Again is &apos;not surprised and not deterred&apos;</strong> regarding Cavangh&apos;s recent announcement of plans to proceed with the purchase of the 20 acres of Galilee Center land bordering the Gillies Grove Nature Reserve.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-8">               
        On Monday October 21st Cavangh announced that they will be moving ahead with the purchase of this land, confirming that a housing development is in their plans. Though disappointed to hear this, Save the Grove Again is more committed than ever to protecting the Grove and countering any plans for development in its vicinity. 
    </p>
    <p class="mb-8">  
        “This latest move by Cavanagh only strengthens our resolve to protect this irreplaceable land,” said Lacey Smith, Chair of Save the Grove Again. “We do not see this as a done deal, but rather as an opportunity to further engage the community and other partners in a constructive dialogue. We are confident that together we can find a solution that satisfies all parties while ultimately saving the Grove once again.”
    </p>
    <p class="mb-8">  
        With many steps still to take, Save the Grove Again will be there to be the voice of the community and help to steer this in the right direction. And with nearly 4400 signatures on our petition (both digital and hard-copy), there is ample support for our collective goals.
