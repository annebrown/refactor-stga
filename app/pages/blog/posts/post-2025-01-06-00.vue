            On a snowy winter&apos;s day, we all can find reasons to appreciate what a beautiful place we have at Gillies Grove. In this video, STGA chair Lacey Smith reaffirms her dedication to the Save the Grove Again initiative, and asks the community to do the same. With her two children by her side, we are reminded why it matters so much that we keep committed to this labor of love.
