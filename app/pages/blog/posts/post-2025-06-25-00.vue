        Hi, my name is Sandy Stephens. I am an outdoor enthusiast with a passion for sharing experiences in nature. I moved to Arnprior about a year and a half ago, and couldn&apos;t believe my luck when I learned that this community has a glorious Old Growth forest! I learned that this forest used to  expand way beyond the town, into the valley and across the Canadian Shield. Yet a precious, tiny portion of that forest has been preserved here. It has been allowed to grow into maturity and support an incredible amount of life and joy for the many creatures that share it. 
    </p>

    <p class="mb-8 text-justify">
        This landscape hasn&apos;t always been so lush; it was covered by the vast Laurentide ice sheet during the most recent ice age. When the ice started retreating 15,000 years ago, the landscape became home to whales when it was covered by the Champlain Sea, and to giant beavers after the water drained. They weren&apos;t the only mammals to arrive. Countless first peoples across many thousands of years made their homes here. For 10,000 years, this forest has grown, adapted, and thrived.  

    </p>

    <p class="mb-8 text-justify">
        Part of this landscape was preserved amongst a ravenous lumber boom, then gifted to the people of Arnprior to access and enjoy by David and Jessie Gillies. The community came together to protect this wonderful space during the 1990&apos;s, and were able to purchase a portion of the land and gift it to the Nature Conservancy of Canada to benefit from their stewardship.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-8 text-justify">
        This summer I am excited to share even more of what I have learned about this precious - and precarious - place. Let&apos;s get back to our roots while standing amongst the roots of the trees that we are so lucky to explore and cherish. 
    </p>
    <p class="mb-8 text-justify">
        On behalf of Save the Grove, Again, I am thrilled to present new monthly events this summer: Grove Roves: guided forest walks.  Join us to explore a precious plot of Old Growth forest wonderfully preserved on the shoreline of the mighty Kitchi Sipi / Ottawa River. Located in the unceded Algonquin territory of Arnprior, we will wander through Gillies Grove Nature Preserve, passing poplars, hemlocks, birch, and sumacs, and a meadow ecotone of impressive biodiversity.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-8 text-justify">
        We will exercise our senses while looking for wildlife: listening for the calls of frogs and birds, noticing the rustle of leaves, and the smell of moist, green, fresh air. Learn about the ancient and recent history of the area while we make our way to the tallest trees in Ontario, the ancient Eastern White Pines. 
    </p>
    <p class="mb-8 text-justify">
        What&apos;s included: an amateur naturalist and experienced guide, first aid trained and certified, will be leading folks along the trails to share interesting details about this special forest. 
    </p>
    <p class="mb-8 text-justify">
        Who the event is for: beginners, adventurers, nature-lovers, serenity-seekers, families, social butterflies, storytellers and the curious. 
    </p>
