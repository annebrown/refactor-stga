                        In this documentary, we follow visionary scientist, conservationist and author, Diana Beresford-Kroeger, on her journey to the most beautiful forests of the northern hemisphere. From the sacred sugi and cedar forests of Japan, the ancient Raheen Wood of Ireland, the walnut and redwood trees of America, to the great boreal forest of Canada, Beresford-Kroeger tells us the amazing stories behind the history and legacy of these ancient forests while also explaining the science of trees and the irreplaceable roles they play in protecting and feeding the planet.

This is a very important film and I hope that all of the politicians in Ottawa receive a copy of it – and the forest ministries around the world.”</span> <br/>- <b>David Suzuki, Scientist, Author and Broadcaster</b>

                        Prepare to be amazed, entertained but also informed about the wonder of ancient forests, around the world and here in Canada. We can not protect what we do not understand and ‘Call of the Forest’ responds to this need beautifully. As Diana Beresford-Kroeger says “Nature is the thread that completes the tapestry of life.” Our understanding of our essential connection to nature, that we can never be apart from it, is crucial to our ability to sustain and protect it.
