            In this video we learn from conservation biologist, Alberto Suárez-Esteban, that old-growth forests are locally, regionally and globally rare. Esteben also explains how the security and health of an old growth forest comes down to the available land it has to expand and grow. The land that has been proposed for sale has the potential to become a frontier for the expansion of Gillies Grove, securing its availability now and for future generations.

            However, currently we sit at a crossroads for the tangible future of Gillies Grove. In one direction we have a beacon for biodiversity, community networking and a thriving old-growth forest for generations to come. In the other we have more pavement, more noise and a town with a deteriorating forest.

        <p class="mb-10 text-base font-medium leading-relaxed sm:text-lg sm:leading-relaxed lg:text-base lg:leading-relaxed xl:text-lg xl:leading-relaxed">
            This is why we call on the Town of Arnprior and its citizens to help Save the Grove Again. Let&apos;s be mature stewards of this land and work together to ensure the security of the forest&apos;s health and move towards a future in which Gillies Grove persists for many generations to come. Not only is Gillies Grove a rare part of nature, it is also Arnprior&apos;s heart. It&apos;s the central organ that connects, cleanses and provides vital nourishment to the people and animals of the town.
