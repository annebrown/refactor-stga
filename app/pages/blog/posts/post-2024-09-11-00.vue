        Arnprior citizens and Volunteers of the Save the Grove Again campaign convened at the Emmanuel Anglican Church, on the corner of Ottawa and Harrington street, this past Saturday September 7th, to share their love and support for the forest and meadow area adjacent to the Gillies Grove to counter yet another proposal to develop this sacred green space.
    </p>
    <p>
        Gathering to protect and save the global rarity that is the Gillies Grove Old-Growth Forest is unfortunately a familiar cause for the community of Arnprior, having gathered only a mere 34 years ago in 1990 to Save the Grove from being developed into a subdivision.
    </p>
    <p>
        The well-attended launch event on Saturday and all the online activity truly shows that the passion is still alive in Arnprior today. We would like to extend our thanks to all that were able to attend the gathering on Saturday and to all of those that have been helping to spread the word. Together we can find a better way!
