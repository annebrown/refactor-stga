    <p class="about-p">
        We are a group of concerned residents committed to preserving Gillies Grove and the land adjacent to the Grove which constitute the environmental and historic heart of Arnprior.
    </p>
    <p class="about-p">
        We envision a safe and healthy community where future generations can continue to learn from, engage with and share access to lands, such as Gillies Grove, that are biodiverse and rich in history and culture.
    </p>
    <p class="about-p">
        To achieve our vision, we will promote community awareness about plans to commercially develop a large portion of the land adjacent to Gillies Grove. We will also advocate for informed and responsible decision-making concerning these plans to ensure the continued public enjoyment of this important site for years to come.
