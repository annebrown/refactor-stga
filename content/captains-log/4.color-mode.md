## Component

The brightness mode component, `@/components/ui/ColorMode.vue` is invoked by `<ShipBow />`:

```vue
<!--------@/components/ship/ColorMode.vue-------------------------------------->
<template>
  <ClientOnly>
    <UButton
        class="h-fit mr-1 ml-0 pl-0"
        :icon="isDark ? 'i-heroicons-sun-20-solid' : 'i-heroicons-moon-20-solid'"
        variant="link"
        :aria-label="isDark ? 'Switch to light mode' : 'Switch to dark mode'"
        @click="isDark = !isDark"
        :ui="{
            leadingIcon: 'text-(--ui-text) size-8 align-bottom'
         }"
    />
  </ClientOnly>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
const colorMode = useColorMode()
const isDark = computed({
  get () {
    return colorMode.value === 'dark'
  },
  set () {
    colorMode.preference = colorMode.value === 'dark' ? 'light' : 'dark'
  }
})
</script>
<!--------@/components/ship/ColorMode.vue-------------------------------------->

```

## Images

The original square STGA logo was visually jarring in dark mode.  It also needed to be converted to SVG for use in other branding assets.

The circular STGA raster image was converted to vector by a bitmap trace using brightness cutoff and edge detection, prioritizing sharp edges. Barnacle nodes were removed, and the path was simplified. Unnecessary nodes were eliminated, and curves were smoothed using the node tool.
