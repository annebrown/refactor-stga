## Component

The brightness mode component, `@/components/ui/ColorMode.vue` is invoked by `<ShipBow />`:

```vue
<!--------@/components/ship/ColorMode.vue-------------------------------------->
<template>
  <ClientOnly>
    <UButton
        class="h-fit mr-1 ml-0 pl-0"
        :icon="isDark ? 'i-heroicons-sun-20-solid' : 'i-heroicons-moon-20-solid'"
        variant="link"
        :aria-label="isDark ? 'Switch to light mode' : 'Switch to dark mode'"
        @click="isDark = !isDark"
        :ui="{
            leadingIcon: 'text-(--ui-text) size-8 align-bottom'
         }"
    />
  </ClientOnly>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
const colorMode = useColorMode()
const isDark = computed({
  get () {
    return colorMode.value === 'dark'
  },
  set () {
    colorMode.preference = colorMode.value === 'dark' ? 'light' : 'dark'
  }
})
</script>
<!--------@/components/ship/ColorMode.vue-------------------------------------->

## Images


The original STGA logos  were visually jarring in dark mode.  They also needed to be converted to SVG to avoid pixelation at larger sizes.  

## Original Raster - Square

The circular STGA raster image was converted to vector by a bitmap trace using brightness cutoff and edge detection, prioritizing sharp edges. Barnacle nodes were removed, and the path was simplified. Unnecessary nodes were eliminated, and curves were smoothed using the node tool.

## Official STGA Square Logo
The resulting image is now resolution-agnostic,  supports CSS styling, including dynamic stroke and fill, and will be used as the single source of truth for all other official images:

## Official STGA Rectangle Logo

The original rectangular logo was created using proprietary image editing software, using private fonts.  A similar, open-source font was found for the text pictured in blue, 'SAVE THE GROVE...'.  For `Again`, no matching free font was found. 

To recreate the 'Again` text, a bitmap-traced path was extracted the same way as the square logo.  The path was then modified, node-by-node, until the word matched the one in the original image.
