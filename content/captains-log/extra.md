## Description

Optional but worthy new features to implement after migration.

### Blogger UI IF

Look for portable app (mobile && desktop && web) to provide bloggers complete domain over the creation, publishing and maintainance of blog content.  When necessary, coded features can be implemented using Markdown components's (supported by the Nuxt/MDC module) in the web site back-end.  Bloggers can invoke coded features by wrapping the feature name with special delimiters (double colon '::').

The simplest approach would be to use a GitHub-sourced CMS service with a free plan.  The CMS service would handle authn and authz, thus reducing complexity, code footprint, STGA site traffic and maintaintenance time.
